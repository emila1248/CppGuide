First, make sure you're in the desired directory, then open the terminal using "ctrl + `".

Type "git init" to initialize a repository.
Type "git add ." to stage your files for commitment.
Type "git commit -m "____" to make your first commit. Your commit message goes inside the quotes.

To connect this repository to a Github repository, use this command:
"git remote add origin ________________"
And fill in the blank with the https link to your Githhub repository.
Type "git status" to see the name of the branch you are in.
If the name is "master", change it to "main" by typing "git branch -m master main".
Type "git status" again to confirm the change.
To start pushing your files to Github, type "git push --set-upstream origin main".

TIPS:
Typing "git branch -l" will show you all the local branches you have.
The local branches are the branches that are stored locally, meaning on your PC.
Typing "git branch -r" will show you all the remote branches you have, meaning the ones kept on Github.
